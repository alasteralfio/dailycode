## DailyCode
###### Alaster Alfio

Starting on 3rd June 2023, I'll be updating this repository with daily projects that I'll do. 

I am currently learning Python, with some prior practice on JavaScript. This is essentially my personal blog, documenting my progress. I do plan on diversifying the languages I use on this repo, though it may not be for another few months.

Update (9/6/2023)
I'm beginning to realise I'll run out of project ideas really fast, so I've decided to add CodeWars challenges. In the future I'll also be doing stuff like LeetCode.

##### Although this markdown will be edited from time to time, it is my first project done on this repo, dated 3/6/2023.
