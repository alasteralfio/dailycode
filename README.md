## DailyCode
###### Alaster Alfio

Starting on 3rd June 2023, I'll be updating this repository with daily projects that I'll do. 

I am currently learning Python, with some prior practice on JavaScript. This is essentially my personal blog, documenting my progress. I do plan on diversifying the languages I use on this repo, though it may not be for another few months.

##### Although this markdown will be edited from time to time, it is my first project done on this repo, dated 3/6/2023.
